/**
 * Measure's programmatic hit API: `POST /m`. This is a wire shape mirrored
 * BY HAND from `packages/schemas/src/measure.ts` for the same reason
 * `observe/envelope.ts` mirrors its own: this package ships to npm with
 * zero runtime dependencies and cannot import an unpublished workspace
 * package.
 *
 * This function exists for programmatic/server-side use -- somewhere a
 * `<script>` tag is not an option (an SSR data layer, a Cloudflare Worker,
 * a batch job re-emitting historical events). It intentionally does NOT
 * duplicate the first-party browser tracker script: a real website should
 * load that script instead, since it is smaller, requires no build step,
 * and (critically, see below) runs in a real browser where the request
 * carries a Origin header no script can forge.
 *
 * ## Read this before using it from Node or a Workers cron/queue handler
 *
 * `POST /m` has no API key or bearer auth: the only gate is the request's
 * `Origin` header, checked against a per-project allowlist of registered
 * domains. A real browser attaches that header itself on every POST,
 * same-origin included, and JavaScript running in a browser cannot override
 * it -- which is exactly what makes it trustworthy as a security control.
 *
 * `fetch` in Node.js and in a Cloudflare Worker has no such page context, so
 * a request built by this function in those environments carries no Origin
 * header at all. The server treats a missing Origin as an automatic reject.
 * That rejection is silent and indistinguishable from success: `POST /m`
 * always answers `204 No Content` with no body, whether the hit was
 * recorded, rejected for its Origin, or sent to an unknown project id, by
 * design (so the endpoint can never be used to enumerate valid project ids
 * or registered domains by an attacker probing it with `curl`). Calling
 * `sendMeasureHit` from a plain Node script or a Workers handler that isn't
 * relaying a real inbound browser request will therefore appear to
 * "succeed" -- the promise resolves, nothing throws -- while recording
 * nothing, forever, with no error to notice.
 *
 * This function deliberately does NOT accept an `origin`/header override to
 * paper over that. Fabricating an Origin value to get a server-side call
 * past the allowlist would defeat the one security control this endpoint
 * has; that is not a trade-off this SDK makes on a caller's behalf. If you
 * have a genuine reason to relay a hit from an edge Worker that already
 * terminated a real browser request, forward the request's own `Origin`
 * header value through your own `fetch` call instead of through this
 * helper.
